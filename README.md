# Titanic
I have made an analysis on Titanic shipwreck incident.
Which gave me an insight of who was most likely to die in the incident.
During My analysis i found that more than 80% men died and only 20% women died.
More than 80% women and kids were safe and only 20 % men who were rich survived the incident.
